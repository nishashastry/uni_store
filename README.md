# Inspiration ðŸ’­
Selling items through Snapchat stories offers students a convenient way to part with unwanted possessions, from game tickets to furniture. Although social media platforms like Snapchat are excellent for showcasing products, they can be marred by fraudulent ads. In 2021, 45% of financial losses in social media scams stemmed from online shopping, where payments were made but the products never arrived. Beyond addressing safety concerns, Uni Store also seeks to enhance the convenience and sustainability of furniture sales by establishing a secure marketplace.
